# OpenAI GPT-4 Repository Setup

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a Conda environment tailored for a project using the OpenAI GPT-4 API.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  
## 1. Installing Conda/Miniconda:

1. **Miniconda:** A minimal installer for conda.
    - [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
    
2. **Anaconda (Optional):** A larger distribution that includes conda, Python, and many scientific packages.
    - [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
    
For most purposes, Miniconda is sufficient.

## 2. Clone the Repository:

To get a copy of this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

\```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK]
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
\```

Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK]` with the actual link to your Git repository and `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]` with the name of your repository.

## 3. Creating a Conda Environment:

Create a new Conda environment:

\```bash
conda create --name openai_env python=3.8
\```

Activate the Conda environment:

\```bash
conda activate openai_env
\```

## 4. Setting up the `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

For security reasons, it's recommended to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. This way, you don't accidentally expose the API key in your scripts or notebooks.

On macOS and Linux:

\```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
\```

On Windows (using Command Prompt):

\```bash
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
\```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## 5. Installing Dependencies:

Assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file for your Python packages, you can install them using:

\```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```
